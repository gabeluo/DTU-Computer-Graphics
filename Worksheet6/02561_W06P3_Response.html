    <h1>Choose a filtering option that betters these minification issues without too much blurring of the texture. Explain your choice.</h1>
    <p>
      The best filtering option that fixes these minification issues is nearest mipmap nearest as it is able to best show the details in the mountains and valleys
      The other options blur out some of the details on the mountains, especially around Chile. This makes sense as using nearest will show better distinctions between
      the white peaks of the mountains compared to the green valleys compared to linear since the point of linear is to blur the transitions together.
