    <h2>a) What is the difference between Phong shading and Phong lighting (the Phong reflection model)?</h2>
    <p>
        The Phong lighting model consider the surface point, the light, and where the viewer is looking from to calculate how much light would
        be reflected to the viewer based on the material of the object. The Phong lighting models consider ambient, diffuse, and specular
        components of the interaction between material and light.
        <br><br>
        The Phong shading model improves on the Gouraud shading model where the surface normal is renormalized at each pixel. The Phong shading model
        determines the colouring of the model based on its shape and the illumination model used. The Phong shading model will evaluate the lighting model
        (which can be the Phong lighting model) at every pixel (by moving the calculations to the fragment shader) and uses the results as the color for the pixel.
        <br><br>
        Simply put, the shading model is used to determine how the lighting model is implemented, while the Phong lighting model determines the effects between the light and material.
    </p>
    <h2>b) What is the difference between flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong
        shading? List pros and cons of each. Is Gouraud or Phong shading the
        best method for simulating highlights? Explain.</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Flat shading</b>
        <br>
        Evaluates the illumination model once per face, showing the differences in shading from the polygons in the mesh.
        <br>
        <i>Pros:</i><br>Simple and fast
        <br>
        <i>Cons:</i><br>Requires a model with lots of small faces to get a relatively good effect. In most cases, the lighting effect is ruined
        because the different faces can be distinguished based on the different shading calculations. In other words, the polygon boundaries are easily visible.
        Flat shading is especially bad used on smooth surfaces as Mach bands will be visible.
        <br><br>
        <b>Gouraud shading</b>
        <br>
        Only evaluates the illumination model at the vertices
        <br>
        <i>Pros:</i><br>Achieves smooth shading compared to flat shading through the use of interpolation, which removes the visible edges between polygons seen with flat shading
        <br>
        <i>Cons:</i><br>Mach bands can still appear<br>The edges between the different polygons can still be visible from the specular highlight, so overall it isn't great with specular reflections
        <br><br>
        <b>Phong Shading</b>
        <br>
        Interpolates normals across the polygon to do individuals calculations at each pixel
        <br>
        <i>Pros:</i><br>Creates a much smoother and more accurate result
        <br>
        Removes Mach bands
        <br>
        Highlights are significantly improved
        <br>
        <i>Cons:</i><br>Adds complexity and requires more calculations due to all the interpolations and normalizations, thus increasing computational costs
        <br><br>
        The Phong shading would be the best method for simulating highlights since it re-nomalizes the direction vectors per pixel
        to compensate for the linear interpolation which shortens the direction vector which is done for Gouraud shading.
        This means that objects with less smooth surfaces will show a better effect in simulating highlights when Phong is used instead of Gouraud.

    <h2>c) What is the difference between a directional light and a point light?</h2>
    <p>
        A directional light doesn't have a position and goes in one direction. The w coordinate is also set to 0.
        <br><br>
        A point light has a designated position and the light direction radiates outwards from the light's position.
        The w coordinate is also set to 1. The intensity of the point source is inversely proportional to the distance from the source to the surface in question
    </p>
    <h2>d) Does the eye position influence the shading of an object in any way?</h2>
    <p>
        When considering the slides on the various shading methods, none of the methods consider the eye position as a factor when rendering shading.
        The light position is considered for a point light, but not the eye position. Hence, the eye position does not influence the shading of an object.
    </p>
    <h2>e) What is the effect of setting the specular term to (0, 0, 0)?</h2>
    <p>
        Setting the specular term to (0, 0, 0) removes the specular highlight from the light completely, essentially removing the shiny component of the object.
        The highlight can also be described as the mirror-like effect from the light that would appear on a shiny object, so in this case this effect wouldn't be shown.
    </p>
    <h2>f) What is the effect of increasing the shininess exponent (ùõº)?</h2>
    <p>
        Increasing the shininess exponent attempts to make the object looks "shinier". In the case of the sphere, increasing the shininess makes the
        white dot/highlight from the shine in a more concentrated area (the specular highlight is smaller). Decreasing the shininess makes the highlight cover a larger area and 
        essentially makes it look more diffused.
    </p>
    <h2>g) In what coordinate space did you compute the lighting?</h2>
    <p>The lighting was computed in world space, not in view space.</p>
