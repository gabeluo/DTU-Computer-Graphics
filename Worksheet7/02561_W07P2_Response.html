    <h1>Explain the transformation.</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of the transformation is to change from normalized device coordinates into world space. The projection poriton is reversed by multiplying by the inverse of the projection matrix.
      This converts from the normalized device coordinates into camera space.<br>
      For the view matrix, only the rotational component should be modified, so the last row and column of the inverse of the view matrix are set to zero
      to reverse the effect from the view matrix, essentially going from camera space to world space.<br>
      The two inverse matrices are multiplied together and used as a transformation matrix on the vertex positions.
