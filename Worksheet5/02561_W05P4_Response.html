    <h1>Explain how you obtain and use surface normals, and explain how this relates to the surface smoothness when you are rendering a triangle mesh.</h1>
    <p>
      For these obj files the surface normals were simply obtained from the obj file itself. Those normals were put in by the original program
      used the generate the model, whether it be blender, SolidWorks, etc. the OBJ parser program reads through the obj file and like the 
      vertices puts them in the respective buffer in the JavaScript code.
      <br><br>
      The surface normals are used to compute the Phong shading and lighting effects on the object. They can also be used as
      texture coordinates for example if a texture was applied to the model.
      <br><br>
      The number of surface normals would determine how smooth the surface looks when rendering a triangle mesh
      The less normals, the more jagged the model will appear. This comparable to creating a sphere, where using 1 subdivision will
      give a much more jagged and rough surface compared to one with 5 subdivisions, which has many more surface normals.
