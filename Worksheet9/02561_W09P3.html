    <h1>Compare projection shadows to shadow mapping by listing advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques.</h1>
    <h2>Projection Shadows</h2>
    <p>
        Pros:
        <br>
        Quick and easy to implement
    </p>
    <p>
        Cons:
        <br>
        Doesn't show any self-shadowing
        <br>
        More inefficient with multiple objects as each object needs to have its own shadow drawn as a separate object
        <br>
        Difficult to implement with more complex shapes (consider how adding alpha blending with a teapot will not work)
    </p>
    <h2>Shadow Mapping</h2>
    <p>
        Pros:
        <br>
        Allows for self-shadowing (consider the little nub at the top of the teapot)
        <br>
        Doesn't require clipping of the shadow
    </p>
    <p>
        Cons:
        <br>
        Quality is determined by the resolution of the shadow map
        <br>
        Aliasing problems (staircase effect at the edge of the shadows)
        <br>
        Can be harder to implement as it takes time to find the proper projection and view matrices for the light source
        <br>
        Unwanted effects or improper shadows can occur if the shadow map precision isn't very high
    </p>
