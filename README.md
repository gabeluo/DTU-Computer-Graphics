# DTU Computer Graphics
 This repository shows my worksheet solutions for the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) Computer Graphics course, Fall 2022.
 
 Note that this code is still a work in progress as the course is ongoing.
 
 Future improvements include:
 - Short descriptions of the tasks for each worksheet
 - Attempt another one of the project ideas
 
 The repository will be updated periodically until the completion of the course.
 
 The course webpage can be found below for reference.

 I have not included the worksheet directives or other reference material as I do not own them and are part of the course content.

Later worksheets (ie. ones with a higher number) have more "exciting" results, as the course was building up from the basics of Computer Graphics and WebGL. The parts within each worksheet are usually a progression to the desired result of the worksheet.

You can navigate through the folders and see the displayed results. This makes viewing the final results easier as some worksheets involve importing files, and some browsers may give errors if this is done locally.
